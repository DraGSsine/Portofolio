    Developed a file organization system designed to
    streamline the management of messy files. The system
    allows users to upload multiple files, such as "untitled.pdf,"
    and leverages the Mistral API to process these files and
    identify their main topics. Based on the identified topic, the
    system renames the files accordingly (e.g.,
    "datascience.pdf") and organizes them into appropriate
    folders (e.g., "Programming")

Introducing DocTify, an innovative file organization system designed to streamline the management of messy files. Developed with cutting-edge technologies such as Redux, React, NestJS, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, AI, and MongoDB, DocTify sets a new standard in file management.

Immerse yourself in a user-friendly interface where Redux's state management ensures a seamless and efficient experience. Users can upload multiple files, such as "untitled.pdf," and DocTify leverages the Mistral API to process these files and identify their main topics. Based on the identified topic, the system renames the files accordingly (e.g., "datascience.pdf") and organizes them into appropriate folders (e.g., "Programming").

React's seamless integration brings the pages to life, delivering an interactive and dynamic journey through your file management tasks. Each component, meticulously designed and optimized, guarantees a smooth navigation experience, allowing you to organize your files with ease and efficiency.

Behind the scenes, NestJS and MongoDB empower our system to handle complex operations and store data securely. The AI capabilities ensure that every file is accurately categorized and renamed, making it a breeze for users to find exactly what they're looking for.
